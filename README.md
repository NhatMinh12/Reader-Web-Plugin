# Reader-Web-Plugin

## Overview

A browser extension that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to provide users with intelligent, contextual information about any webpage they are visiting.
It allows users to "ask" questions about the current webpage's content, obtaining informative and relevant responses from the AI, whether it's asking for a summary of a lengthy article, clarification on technical jargon, or even a request to fact-check a statement.

## Key features

1. Contextual Querying: Users can ask questions about the webpage they're currently visiting, and the plugin will provide answers in real-time, leveraging the GPT-3.5 model's ability to understand and generate human-like text.
2. Highlight and Ask: Users can highlight specific text on a webpage and ask questions about it specifically, allowing for detailed inquiries about complex topics.
3. Page Summary: Generate a succinct summary of a webpage, ideal for long articles or dense technical documentation.
4. Fact-checking: Users can ask the plugin to verify information on the webpage using its built-in ability to compare against known data.
